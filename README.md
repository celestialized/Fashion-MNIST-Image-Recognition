# Fashion-MNIST-Image-Recognition

### Goal

The aim of this project is to recognize and classify images of Fashion MNIST dataset using deep neural network. 

Also, along with correct classification, the aim is to learn different activation functions (RELU and LEAKY RELU), try different Optimizer choices to evaluate the performance of the model.

### Tools and Techniques

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Deep Neural Network, Keras, Numpy, MatplotLib

### Dataset
Fsahion MNIST is dataset with 10 different Fashion Objects with 60,000 images in Train dataset and 10000 images in test data.
